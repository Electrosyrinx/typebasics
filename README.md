## About
This is a website about Typography that involved two of my courses in my first year at college.

* IMG 112 (Typography) - The website was inspired by a poster I made for this class. I discovered an easy way to make a QR code in Adobe InDesign, and I was enamored by the idea of putting a QR code on my poster. To see this poster, follow this link: https://www.behance.net/gallery/49477227/Typographics-Now-Poster-Project-(NIC-IMG-208)

* IMG 111 (Web Tools 2 - JavaScript) - Because the QR code on my typography poster needs to actually go somewhere, I created a website using JavaScript and jQuery animations. Inspired by the poster, I had a vision of words spinning around with the circular graphic used in the poster. I came fairly close to coding what I had envisioned, and this website was the end result of that.
